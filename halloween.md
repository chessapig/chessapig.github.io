# Halloween costumes

Every year I make a math halloween costume for my department costume contest.  Here are past years:

## 2023: Horuse

<img src="/assets/images/halloween/vicky.jpg" alt="horse costume with two people. The front is coverd in brown cloth. The back is weaing a hat that looks like a tail. Between them, the horse body is a torus. Two others people smile happily in the torus. " width="600">

Is it a horse? Or is it a torus?

The horuse skeleton was an innovative construction, entirely made of woven plastic tubing held together by friction.

this was an integrable part in my trick-o-treating costume this year, where the torus was the shell for my snail.

## 2022: Bott and Tu

Some much needed explanation: I, the golfer (right) managed to get the golf ball into the hole (left) in two strokes. The hole, of course, is on the butt. Therefore, I got butt in two. Bott in two. Bott in two. Bott and Tu. Like, you know, the textbook.

Somehow, this won.

On the left, a person with a green shirt, a flag on their head, and a sign reading 'bott hole'. attached to their butt, is a golf hole with a golf ball inside. " width="600" class="center">


## 2021: The springer textbook

Specifically, "category theory for a working mathematician" by sandy mclane. Scariest thing I could think of, the definition of associativity for a 4-category.

Beheath the shirt is pages of category theory spilling out. Elliot holds 'category theory for the working mathematician' by sanders mclane" width="600">
