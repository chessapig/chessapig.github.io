# Mathematical interests

I'm interested in mathematical physics and using physical ideas to study objects in geometry (broadly construed. Here is a list of areas which I want to study:

Moduli spaces, gauge theory, Higgs bundles, Hyperkahler geometry, integrable systems, mirror symmetry, supersymmetric/topological quantum field theories, small quantities of string theory

## Hyperbolic band theory thru Higgs bundles

- This work is joint with Steve Rayan, and was published in *Advances in mathematics*:
[Hyperbolic Band Theory Through Higgs Bundles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870822004819)
- You can watch my MSRI talk about this project [here](https://www.msri.org/seminars/26865)

This project explores a bridge between algebraic geometry and condensed matter physics. On the physics end, we consider the quantum physics of hyperbolic crystals. Imagine an electron on a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane, evolving under a potential that is periodic under a set of hyperbolic translations. For example, Fig. 1 shows a regular hyperbolic crystal. The quantum properties come from the spectral theory of an associated periodic Schrodinger operator. We can understand the spectrum much better if we split it according to representations of the symmetries, a technique called *hyperbolic band theory*.

In algebraic geometry land, representations of the crystal symmetries become vector bundles on Riemann surfaces (See [Hyperbolic band theory](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe9170)). In this project, we extend this theory to Higgs bundles, a complexified analog of Higgs bundles. We find two independent crystalographic interpretations of Higgs bundles, one from the algebro-geometric side of Higgs bundles, and the other from the representation-theoretic side.
