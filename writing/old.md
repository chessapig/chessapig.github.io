        Hyperbolic lattices underlie a new form of quantum matter with potential applications to quantum computing and simulation and which, to date, have been engineered artificially. A corresponding hyperbolic band theory has emerged, extending 2-dimensional Euclidean band theory in a natural way to higher-genus configuration spaces. Attempts to develop the hyperbolic analogue of Bloch's theorem have revealed an intrinsic role for algebro-geometric moduli spaces, notably those of stable bundles on a curve. We expand this picture to include Higgs bundles, which enjoy natural interpretations in the context of band theory. First, their spectral data encodes a crystal lattice and momentum, providing a framework for symmetric hyperbolic crystals. Second, they act as a complex analogue of crystal momentum. As an application, we elicit a new perspective on Euclidean band theory. Finally, we speculate on potential interactions of hyperbolic band theory, facilitated by Higgs bundles, with other themes in mathematics and physics.

        String art are emergent patterns arising by stretching straight lines across a circle according to mathematical rules. We re-contextualize string art, envisioning the circle as the circle at infinity of the hyperbolic plane. The strings stretch across the Beltrami-Klein model of the hyperbolic plane, each line a hyperbolic geodesic. We examine the string art coming from Mobius transforms. The string art is described by its envelope, a curve tangent to every string stretching across a circle. We describe the envelopes of a Mobius transform in terms of the underlying hyperbolic symmetry: Elliptic Mobius transforms give hyperbolic circle envelopes, parabolic transforms give horocycles, and hyperbolic transforms give hypercircles. We conclude with a purely aesthetic application, showing a hyperbolic string art fractal. <br><br>

        this was accepted to Bridges 2023, but I wasn't able to go. See  <a href="/blog/2023/02/16/Hyperbolic.html">this post</a> to play around with string art for various hyperbolic transforms. Also check out <a href="https://twitter.com/chessapigbay/status/1584141465734635520">this thread</a> for some more pretty pictures and stories about string art.

# Informal Writing
- I write math threads on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chessapigbay/status/1295244192722169857) 
- I sometimes upload things to my [blog](/blog), which are generally less polished than my twitter threads.
- I've recently started a [math diary](/writing/diary.html), where I write about things I learn about that given day. This is entirely unpolished and unedited, but is perhaps of interest to someone.
