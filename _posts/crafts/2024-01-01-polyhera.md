# Summary
Welcome to math crafts! Today, we will follow the footsteps of the greeks and others before, and discover the platonic solids. Attaching flat pieces of paper cut into polygons together, we can force the polygons to pop out of the plane by controlling the number surrounding each vertex.

To make easy-to-attach polygons without tape or glue, we use interlocking paper tabs. I make some templates (see below), highly inspired by [itsPhun](https://www.itsphun.com/). If you want heavy-duty plastic versions of these interlocking polygons, you can buy some there.

### Materials
Each student will need:
- 6 sheets of construction paper and a printed template  (details below)
- Scissors 
- (optional) access to tape
   
   
### Setup
Precision is important, specifically for the cut that ends halfway through the tab. Cutting through a stack of papers with scissors and a template gives rather unsatisfying, shoddy results. With a little prepreperation, things go more smoothly. We will use a trick inspired by [George hart](https://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/paper-models.html). Place a template above a stack of construction paper or cardstock, all utop a scrap piece of cardboard. Then, hammer a nail through all the layers at the essential points of the template. Nail the endpoint of the slit (Important to get this precise!) and the corners of the polygon.  
    
This has a few benefits: The nail holes hold the paper aligned together. This makes it easy to hand out whole stacks of paper, and lets the students easily cut the whole stack at once. They only need to cut to the holes, and need not worry about precision.  Also, the scraggly nail holes hold the tabs together quite well. Compare the build quality below: Left is without nails, right is with nails.

I organize my 20 students into 5 tables, 4 students each. For each table, make:
 -  1 [4-pentagon template], with 6 sheets of construction paper underneath.
 - 1 [8-square template], with 6 sheets of a different color paper underneath
 - 2 [12-triangle templates], with 6 sheets underneath each 

In total, we need
- 120 sheets of construction paper, split amongst 3 colors (30, 30, and 60 each)
- 5 printed pentagon templates, 5 printed square templates, 10 printed triangle templates
   
This needs 1240 total punches

# Platonic solids
Today you will rediscover the platonic solids, a great early accomplishment of geometry. Just like the mathematicians of old, you won't know the answers ahead of time. Instead, I'll suggest questions for you to ask, and your explorations and curiosity will lead you ahead. You might not answer the original question, but you will understand something along the way.

For us to talk about these questions together, we need a common language for 3D shapes. Today we're only going to think about shapes made of flat sheets attached together. These are called *Polyhedra*.  The flat parts of the polyhedra are called *faces*. Each of these is a 2 dimensional shape (a *polygon*). The boundary of each face is a collection of one dimensional line segments called *edges*, and the corners of each face are points called *vertices*.  
<div class="text-center">

</div>
**Understanding check:**  How many faces, edges, and vertices does a cube have? (pictured above)

Define a *platonic solid* as a 3 dimensional shape with the following properties:
- Each face is a regular polygon, every face with the same number of edges
- every vertex is surrounded by the same number of faces

**Question 1:** Build as many platonic solids as you can think of. How many could you find? How many faces does each

    <h4 class="card-header">
        <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapse-2" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapse-example" id="heading-example" class="d-block">

        <div class="card-body" markdown="1">

We need to know:
  
1.  the number of sides of each face
2. the number of faces around each vertex

We go through case by case:
**3 triangles per vertex:** This results in a 4-sided pyramid known as a tetrahedron

**5 triangles per vertex:** This results in the 20-sided icosahedron

<div class="text-center">
<img src="/assets/crafts/polyhedra/icosahedron.jpg" alt="paper model of icosahedron" height="300" >
</div>

**3 squares per vertex:** This results in a cube, sometimes also called the hexahedron. It is 6-sided.

</div>
</div>
<br>


**Question 2:** As mathematicians, once we discover something, we need to give it a name -- how else can we discuss it with one another? Come up with names for the platonic solids you've made. Try to make it so someone who just knows the name could figure out how to build the shape. 
(if you already know names for these shapes, can you come up with better names?)

You can make up many names, but here's what math history has decided on. To build a platonic solid, we only need to know:
1.  the number of sides of each face
2. the number of faces around each vertex

So our name needs to describe these two numbers. Lets say the number of sides on the face is $p$, and the number of faces around the vertex is $q$. Then, we write the associated platonic solid as $\\{p,q\\}$. This is called the [Schläfli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol) of the solid. It doesn't look much like a name, but it is very good at distinguishing different solids like any good name-tag. 

Of course, these shapes also have names with letters in them. See the table below. The names come from greek, indicating the number of faces for each solid. The number of faces does uniquely describe each object among platonic solids, but gives no indication of how to build it. 

| sides on each face | faces on each vertex | Schläfli symbol | Number of faces | Common name |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 3 | 3 | $\\{3,3\\}$ | 4 | Tetrahedron |
| 3 | 4 | $\\{3,4\\}$ | 6 | Cube (Hexahedron) |
| 4 | 3 | $\\{4,3\\}$ | 8 | Octahedron|
| 5 | 3 | $\\{5,3\\}$ | 12 | Dodecahedron|
| 3 | 5 | $\\{3,5\\}$ | 20 | Icosahedron |

</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>


**Question 3:** Are there any other platonic solids you haven't built? Can you prove there are no more?

Hint:  Think about the angles around each vertex. Here are the angles for each regular polygon

| number of sides | angle |
|--|--|
| 3 | $\pi/3$ |
| 4 | $\pi/2$ |
| 5 | $3\pi/5$ |
| 6 | $2\pi/3$ |
| $\vdots$ | $\vdots$ |

We measured the angles using radians, where the circle has a total of $2 \pi$ radians. See if you can verify these angles by placing the polyhedron on the chart below:

First we try to make polyhedra out of only triangles. How many triangles can we fit around each vertex? We saw we could make 3,4, and 5. If we try to put 6 triangles around, the total angle around the vertex is $2 \pi$. So, the triangles stay flat in the plane, and the triangles never closes up into a sphere. A similar thing happens for 7 or more triangles. 

We see from the triangle case that we can't form a sphere unless the total angle around a vertex is less than $2 \pi$.  Let's apply this to squares now! Using the angle chart, we can fit at most 3 squares around each vertex (which gives a cube), and no more. For pentagons, we can fit at most 3.  For hexagons, we can fit only 2, which gives a degenerate polyhedra. This continues for all higher angles. 

Therefore, the only platonic solids are those constructed above.

**Question 4:** You should have found a platonic solid with 5 triangles around each 
vertex. What happens if you put 6 around a vertex? 7? (you might want to cut off the tabs and use tape for 7 or more).

Likewise, what happens when you put 4 squares around a vertex? 5? 

Can you determine a rule which relates the behavior of a vertex to the angles of the faces surrounding it?

Therefore, the only platonic solids are those constructed above.


There are three different behaviors depending on the sum of angles around the vertex. 
1. If the sum of angles is less than $2 \pi$, then the construction closes up and we get a platonic solid. We call this *Spherical*
2. If the sum of angles is equal to $2 \pi$, then we get a tiling of flat space. This regiem is called *Euclidean* 
3. If the sum of angles is greater than $2 \pi$, then the vertex is still forced out of the plane, but in an unusual way. We will investigate this regieme more next week. We deem this *hyperbolic*

The behavior depends on the Schläfli symbol according to the following table, from a book by [Robert Fathauer](https://twitter.com/RobFathauerArt/status/1129087988355424257). Yellow is spherical, red is euclidean, and blue is hyperbolic.

**Question 5:** Platonic solids are pretty restrictive, so let's consider a more general family of symmetric shapes. Define a *Arcehemedian solid* as a 3 dimensional shape with the following properties:
- Each face is a regular polygon, though different faces may have different numbers of sides
- every vertex is surrounded by the same combination of polygons (e.g, every face is surrounded by 2 squares and 2 triangles)

Construct a few different archemedian solids, and compute the total angle around each vertex. Are these more or less than $2\pi$?

There are many archemedian solids to make. Here is one called the *cubeoctoahedron*, where each vertex has 2 triangles and 2 squares, alternating as you move around the vertex. The total angle around the vertex is $5 \pi/3$.

Once you have a sufficiently varied family of solids, bring them to the front of the class under the whiteboard. Sort them by size (according to how the students vote, let them decide amongst themselves). Then abbove each, write the angle defect ($2\pi$ minus the angle around each vertex). Ask students what they notice. They should see that the smaller the angle defect, the larger the shape (rougly). Explain how angle defect controls curvature, and the more tighly curved the sphere is, the smaller it must be. We will see more examples of this later.
