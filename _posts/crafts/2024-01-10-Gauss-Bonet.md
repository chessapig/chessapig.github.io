summary: "*Math:* Learn about the gauss-bonnet theorem, relating the number of holes in an object to its total curvature. See this from multiple perspectives. The Euler formula for polyhedra relates angle defect to topology. The geodesic curvature of triangles on the surface relates total rotation to topology. The monodromy perspective relates topology to the experience of an ant walking along the surface."
