summary: "*Craft:* Using skewers and rubber bands, build wodden models of the hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid.


*Math:* Create ruled surfaces, surfaces made by tracing out lines. Analyze their gaussian curvature. Make doubly ruled surfaces, and observe how they flex."

# Summary
 We have seen several way to construct surfaces with negative curvature, based around excess angles or excess length. Now we will go backwards, starting from a way of constructing surfaces, and finding that they naturally manifest negative curvature. We will examine *Ruled surfaces*, surfaces traced out by a line moving through three dimensional space. The quintessential examples are the *hyperbolic paraboloid* (seen in [[Hyperbolic origami]]), and the *hyerpboloid* (like the large cooling towers in nuclear powerplant). Ruled surfaces are particularly easy to construct, so they are often used in architecture. 

# Activity
