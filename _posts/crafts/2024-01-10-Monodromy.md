summary: "*Craft:* play more with orange peels. Walk around in simulations of spherical and hyperbolic space (image to right from game *hyperbolica*). How does it feel to live in a curved space?


*Math:* Learn about monodromy, how walking in a circle in curved space causes you to rotate. Use this to recontextualize everything in the class."
