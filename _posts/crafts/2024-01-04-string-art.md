summary:  "*Craft:* sew thread through evenly spaced holes around the perimeter of a circle according to a simple pattern. Connect each hole to the hole a constant rotation around the circle. Observe the emergent circular patterns.


*Math:* relate the radius of a polygon to its side length and angles. Understand curvature of a curve as angle per unit distance. "

# summary
We've seen a couple ways to force crafts to pop out of the plane, a process we called "curvature". Today we will discover how to quantitatively measure curvature. We start in 2d: for a curved line scribbled on a piece of paper, can we describe how much it curves, and in which direction it curves? We will investigate equilateral polygons and stars, seeing the relationship between curvature and circles.  We make polygons by stretching stings across a circle, creating beautiful, intricate patterns called *string art*.

## Part 1: thinking about curvature

Mathematical definitions are designed to capture our intuitions. A quantitate measurement of curvature will eventually serve as our definition. Before we can quantify, we need to understand our intuition better -- what curves are curvy and which ones aren't?

*Pedagogical note:* If you have blackboards, give each student chalk and strongly encourage them to write on the blackboards. 

**Question 1:**  Draw some curvy pencil strokes, some straight pencil strokes, and some straight pencil strokes. Compare with others at your table. What curves are the curviest? What attributes are shared by the curviest strokes?
