summary: "*Craft:* Create origami with curved creases, and see what sorts of forms we can make. Can we fold a sphere? How close can we get?


*Math:* Introduce gaussian curvature. The curved origami produces developable surfaces, which are surfaces with zero gaussian curvature. Examine the possible forms of these developable surfaces."

Here is a hexagonal sphericon, which rolls in a funny wobbly way
