Today I read about the geometry underlying the brains perception of vision. In particular, the visual cortex has a contact structure, the standard one on $\mathbb{R}^3$. This helps us distinguish contours. I will give a talk about this on friday, so I'll write in more detail later.

Also, aparently binocular vision makes the visual sphere have not a spherical metric, but a hyperbolic one. See the results here:
