Today I started trying to understand the Chiral De-Rahm complex. I find the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9803041.pdf) very hard to parse, because I don't understand vertex algebras. To me, it looks like a soup of algebraic structures.  skimmed through parts the paper [Elliptic Genera and Applications to Mirror Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9904126), which looks more approachable for me. There is also the physics perspective in [Chiral de Rham complex and the half-twisted sigma-model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0504074.pdf), which includes a Dolbeaut resolution of the Chiral De Rahm complex -- more research needed.

Regardless, right now I'm trying to get a flavor for the Chiral De Rahm complex. Its clear that, if I want to really understand this, I have to go back and finally learn conformal field theory and vertex algebras. Which will take a while. I quite like parts of the book [A mathematical introduction to CFT](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-68628-6) by Schottenloher, I think its time to go back and read the whole thing.
