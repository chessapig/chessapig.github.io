Here's a crazy fact I just learned: For a compact Kahler manifold, the cohomology ring determines the manifold up to homotopy. This is called the formality theorem, and is from the paper [Real homotopy theory of KÃ¤hler manifolds](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01389853), by Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, John Morgan & Dennis Sullivan. More precisely, any morphism between kahler manifolds that preserves the cohomology ring must also preserve homotopy type. 

A similar theorem is whiteheads theorem, which states that any map between CW complexes that preserves homotopy groups must be a homotopy equivelence. The Homotopy groups are a much stronger invariant than the cohomology ring. If we assume a manifold is compact kahler, then the extreme power of hodge theory restricts things to the point that the cohomology is enough.
