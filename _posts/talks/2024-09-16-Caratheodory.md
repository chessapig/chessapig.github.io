summary: 'We call a point on a surface in $\mathbb{R^3}$ *umbilic* if both its principal curvatures are equal. The Carathedory conjecture, circa 1920s, posits that every topological sphere, embedded convexly in $\mathbb{R^3}$,  has at least two umbilic points. I will discuss a (controversial) purported proof of the Carathedory conjecture using symplectic geometry and J-holomorphic curves, due to [Guilfoyle and Klingenberg](https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0851). This involves thinking of a surface though its congruence of normal lines, which traces out a lagrangian in the moduli space of lines in $\mathbb{R^3}$. The umbillic points are exactly the complex points of the lagrangian.'
