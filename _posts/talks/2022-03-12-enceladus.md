summary: Not math. I explain how we know that Saturn's moon Enceladus has a global subsurface ocean, following the paper 'Enceladus measured physical libration requires a global subsurface ocean' by Thomas et.al. In particular, I have a nice explination with pictures of libration and forced libration, and how we can use it to study planets.
