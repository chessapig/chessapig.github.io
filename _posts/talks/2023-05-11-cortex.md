summary: When we see, the data from our eyes streams into the seemingly impenetrable jumble of neurons and synapses called our brain. In between, the signal passes through the _visual cortex_, a few layers of preprocessing which converts our visual field into abstract shapes. To do this, it seems evolution discovered differential geometry. First, the orientation of neurons in the visual cortex traces out a _contact structure_, a field of planes in R^3 tangent to no 2-dimensional submanifold. This automatically traces contours around everything we see. Second, the shape of the neurons themselves follow orbits of Euclidean and conformal symmetries, ensuring our perception is invariant under change of perspective. Together, this geometry will reveal itself to us through illusions and hallucinations.
