summary: Philosophically, quantization converts functions on symplectic manifolds to opreators on hilbert spaces in a structure-preserving way. A symplectic manifold carrying a structure-preserving $$G$$-action quantizes to a $$G$$-action on the hilbert space, or a representation of $$G$$. Using this, we can study representations through the geometry of symplectic manifolds. After outlining this philosophy, I describe a parralelism between symplectic manifolds and representations. Coadjoint orbits are irricudible representations, the moment map is a decomposition into irriducible representations. Constructions which engineer new representations become blueprints for building new symplectic manifolds. These constructions motivate *hyperspherical varieties*, the class of spaces starring in [relative langlands duality](https://www.math.ias.edu/~akshay/research/BZSVpaperV1.pdf)

## Dictionary between symplectic manifolds and representations

Over the course of these two talks, I outlined a parralelism between symplectic manifolds and representations. This is based on philosophically extending a collection of results, which I want to collect all in one place. If there's something I should know, please let me know!

I'll be building off the standard dictionary provided by geometric quantization. this procedure is a beautiful idea which only half works, and needs a bunch of extra structures and requirements for things to make senes. See, for example,  [Lectures on geometric quantization, by Bates and Weinstein](https://math.berkeley.edu/~alanw/GofQ.pdf) for details and caveats.

| Symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ | Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}(M)$ | |
| Algebra of smooth functions $C^\infty(M)$ with poisson bracket | algebra of linear operators $\mathcal{H}(M) \to \mathcal{H}(M)$ with commutator| |
| $T^*X$ | $\mathcal{H}(T^*X) = L^2(X)$| Geometric qunatization with a real polarization. This was understood since the dawn of quanutm mechanics, with the work of Weyl |
| $(M,\omega)$ compact kahler, with line bundle $L$ with curvature $\omega$ | $\mathcal{H}(T^*X) = H^0(M,L)$| Geometric quantization with complex polarization. This was developed by Konstant and Souriau in the 70's, to generalize Kirillov's orbit method (see below) |

Now we introduce $G$-actions, one preserving the symplectic structure on $M$, and its induced linear action on the hilbert space $G\circlearrowright  \mathcal{H}$. The results below paint a picture of old-school picture of geometric quantization as an extention of the orbit method. The fundamental structure is the moment map $\mu: M \to \mathfrak{g}^\*$ defining the $G$-action on $M$, which equivariantly relates $G\circlearrowright M$ to the coadjoint action $G\circlearrowright \mathfrak{g}^*$. The coadjoint orbits provide a natural way to decompose $M$. To be safe, we'll assume $G$ is compact reductive, but many of the facts are more general.

See [Kirillov's book on the orbit method](https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-64/). In the complex polarization, the hilbert space is $\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{O}\_\alpha) = H^0(\mathcal{O\_\alpha},L\_\alpha)$. By the Borel-Weil theorem, this is an irriducible representation of $G$ with weight $\alpha$.|

| The action of $G \times G$ on $T^*G$ on left and right is multiplicity free | $G \times G \circlearrowright L^2(G)$ decomposes as $\bigoplus\_\alpha E\_a\otimes E\_a^\*$ (the *peter-weyl theorem*) | This is the prototypical multiplicty-free behievor. This fact is used in *GS84*[^GS84] to prove the general case that multiplicity free manifolds have multiplicity free representations | 
| *Symplectic induction*: If $H \circlearrowright S$ is a hamiltonian $H$-space, and $H < G$ we can build a hamiltonian $G$-space  $\text{h-ind}\_H^G(S) = (S \times T^* G) //H$ | if $V$ is a representation of $H \subset G$, we can build the *induced representation* $ind_H^G(V)$| This was floating around for a while before being formalized. One early use is in *KKS78*[^KKS78] |
|*Hamiltonian restriction* For $G\circlearrowright M$ hamiltonian, $H < G$, we can treat $M$ as an $H$-space | For $H< G$ and a represetation $\rho: G \circlearrowright \mathcal{H}$, we have the *restricted represetation* $Res^G_H(\rho): H \circlearrowright \mathcal{H}$ | |
| $\text{Hom}_G(X,\text{h-ind}_H^G Y) = \text{Hom}_H(\text{res}^G_H(X),Y)$ where $Hom_G(X,Y) = (X^- \times Y) //G$, $X^-$ the reversed symplectic form.  | *Frobenius reciprocity:*  for $\rho$ a $G$-rep and $\psi$ an $H$-rep, <br /> $\langle Ind_H^G \psi,\rho \rangle_H = \langle  \psi, Red_H^G\rho \rangle$  | This was first noticed in a specific case in *KKS78*[^KKS78], but is discussed in much more detail in *GS83b*[^GS83b]. There it is proved for coadjoint orbits, and the form written here comes from *RZ20*[^RZ20]|


## About the picture

The picture shows the splitting of a symplectic manifold $$M$$ with hamiltonian $$G$$ action into slices via its moment map $$\mu:M \to \mathfrak{g}^*$$. The $$G$$-action on $$M$$ is equivariantly mapped to the coadjoint action $$G\circlearrowright \mathfrak{g}^*$$. The $$G$$-invariant sets on $$\mathfrak{g}^*$$ are the coadjoint orbits $$\mathcal{O}$$. The fibers $$\mu ^{-1} (\mathcal{O})$$ are $$G$$- bundles over the symplectic reductions $$M //_\mathcal{O} G = \mu^{-1}(\mathcal{O})/G$$. See the labeled picture below.
