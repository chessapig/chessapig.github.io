summary: The moduli space of polygons encodes how many ways you can bend the edges of a 3D polygon, ensurign the distance between adjacent points remains the same. In this talk, I gave people physical models of polygons, and had them figure out the moduli space up to rigid rotations. This reveals quite a lot of deep structure. Symplectic geometry, coadjoint orbits, toric geometry, and quiver varieties all come into play. We can even reframe the moduli space gauge theoretically as that of some flat connections on the punctured sphere. This web of equivlences make polygon spaces useful testing grounds. This is amplified when we pass to their hyperkahler analoug, the *hyperpolygon space*, who connects with nakajima quiver varieties and the moduli space of Higgs bundles.

# Polygon moduli spaces
A confirguration of a *polygon* with specifed edge lengths is a collection of points in 3 dimensional space such that the distance between two conencted points equals the specified edge length. What is the moduli space of these configurations, up to overall rotation? What is its topology? This is a very concrete question, because you can physically build and play with these polygons, to try to figure it out. The ingredients are:
- Skewers (or any small stick)
- Duct tape
Simply cut the skewers to the desired length, hold the sticks tip-to-tail (but not quite touching), and tape them together. The joint is suprisignly flexible and durable. With a few minutes of arts and crafts, you can have an army of polygons to play with!

In this talk, I handed everyone some of my homemade polygons, and had people reason through the following few questions.

- Question: What is the moduli space of a triangle with specified edge lengths?
	- Answer: Zero, any two such triangles are the same up to rotation
- What about a quadralateral?
	- Generically, it's 2 dimensional
- What about a pentagon? an n-gon?
	- counting equations and degrees of freedom, it is (generically) 2n-6. 
- What is the moduli space of a quadralateral?
	- This one is much trickier if you can't play around with it. There are two possible angles, the angle at a specified vertex, and the dihedral angle bending the quadraleateral across the oppisite diagonal. The radius of the dihedreal angle circle changes with the vertex angle. In fact, for the two extremes of the vertex angle, all dihedral bendings are equivlent. Thus, the circles pinch to points, and the moduli space is a sphere.

## Symplectic geometry
We've figured out the topology. But what is the geometry? Well, it turns out you can very naturally think of the moduli space as a symplectic manifold. It arises from the product of n spheres (one per side of the quadralateral) with its natural symplectic structure, then symplectically reducing by the $$SO(3)$$ action. The moment map$$\mu$$ measures the sum of all the edges, so the condition that $$\mu = 0$$ is equivlent to saying the polygon is closed. Thus, the symplectic reduction 

$$(S^2)^n//SO(3) = \mu^{-1}(0)/SO(3)$$
is the n-gon moduli space. For more information on the symplectic structure of the sphere and this $$SO(3)$$ action, see [my blog post on symplectic and toric geometry](/code/toric).

## toric structure
These polygon moduli spaces carry many more rich structures. For one, these are *toric* symplectic manifolds. We saw this already with the quadralateral, where the dihedral angle was the angle coordinate, and the vertex angle determines the action coordinate. Specifically, the action coordinate is the length of the oppisite diagonal. That means the hamiltonain vector field for the "diagonal length" function generates this dihedral bending. Similarly, in an n-gon, the torus action comes from dihedral bending on the $$n-3$$ missing diagonal edges, and the moment map measures the length of these diagonals (See [Kapovich and Millson, The symplectic geometry of polygons in euclidean space](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kapovich/EPR/space.pdf)). Its lots of fun to construct a pentagon, play around with it, and graph what possible lengths the two missing diagonals can take. They trace out a convex 2D polygon, which is exactly the toric diagram for the polygon moduli space!

## quiver varieties
But there's more still! These polygon spaces serve as the concrete realizations of many fancier ideas. For example, you can represent the direction of each stick as a point in $$\mathbb{CP}^1$$, or as a 1-dimensional complex subspace of $$\mathbb{C}^2$$. The polygon moduli space is a collection of $$n$$ 1-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^2$, up to linear transforms $$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$$ of $\mathbb{C}^2$. (This is a manifestation of the Kampf-Ness theorem: The symplectic reduction by the real group $$SU(2)$$ is the same as simply quotienting by its complexification $$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$$). Let's draw the vector spaces that go in to the above construction: They're described by a graph, one node per vector space, and an arrow whenever one maps to another.

Here the middle nodes has dimension 2, while all the outer ones have dimension 1. This is called a *Star shaped quiver*, for very reasonable reasons. The polygon moduli space are the first example of a *Quiver variety!* I spent a good while this semester trying to understand quiver varieties, in the context of [Coloumb branches](/teaching/coloumb).

## Moduli of vector bundles
Another cool piece of gemetry. We can thing of the moduli of polygons as represented by a list of directions, one per side, on the sphere. We can represent this moduli space of points on the sphere using, of all things, gauge theory. We think of each stick as a translation (as an element of the lie algebra $$\mathfrak{sl}_2$$, attached to each missing point. By the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, we can always cook up some rank 2 bundle on the sphere missing these points, whose monodromy around the missing points are exactly these translations. So, from a polygon, we get a flat bundle on the $$n$$-times punctured sphere.

With this correspondence, the moduli space of polygons in actually an open, dense subset of the moduli space of such flat bundles. Now we can learn about these moduli spaces of connections, which everyone cares about, using polygons! for example, [Kapovich and Millson](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~kapovich/EPR/space.pdf) realized the torus action (Described above) coincides with the almost-toric action of [Jeffery and Weistman](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/communications-in-mathematical-physics/volume-150/issue-3/Bohr-Sommerfeld-orbits-in-the-moduli-space-of-flat-connections/cmp/1104251961.full). 


## Hyperkahler analouge

Things get truely useful when we complexifying the quiver, by including *backwards* arrows. These are maps that go back from the two dimensional central space to the sattelite one-dimensional spaces. The resulting quiver variety is called the *nakajima quiver variety*. The ordinary quiver variety, the polygon space, is Kahler, but this new space is *Hyperkahler*. That means it locally looks like the cotangent bundle of a Kahler manifold. Globally, where the Kahler manifold is complex, the hyperkahler manifold is like the complexifed complex numbers, the *quaterionions*. We call the new variety the hyperpolygon space, because it is a hyperkahler analoug of the ordinary polygon space.

Hyperkahler manifolds are much harder to understand, and these hyperpolygon spaces are the perfect testing ground. A nontrivial example which we truely understand. It has gotten much attention, see Proudfoot's work, like [Hyperpolygon spaces and their cores](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0308218.pdf). But remember how polygon spaces were secretly moduli of bundles over $$\mathbb{P}^1$$? If god is nice to us, hyperbolygon spaces should be the *complexification* of the moduli of vector bundles, which is called the moduli space of Higgs bundles. It is a blessed day, because that's exactly what happens! We can generalize this to vector bundles and Higgs bundles over higer genus surfaces by adding loops to our quiver. Instead of being star-shaped, it becomes comet shaped. (See [Rayan and Schaposnik, Moduli space of generalized hyperpolygons](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06911.pdf))

All together, the moduli space of polygons is a very concrete object which can be understood in many different ways. It's generalizations are some of the core examples of hyperkahler manifolds and metrics. With them, we can better understand some of the more intrensically interesting hyperkahler manifolds, like the moduli space of Higgs bundles.
