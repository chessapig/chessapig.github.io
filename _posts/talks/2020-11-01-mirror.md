summary: This talk states mirror symmetry, framed as a conjecture about the equivlence of two frobenius manifolds. Two sorts of 'topological twisting' should give equivlent topological field theories. The first gives the A-model, which is a path integral counting holomorphic curves in a kahler manifold. The second gives the B-model, a Landau-Ginzburg theory whose physics depends on the singularity structure of a holomorphic function. Underlying both is the structure of a frobenius manifold-- Mirror symmetry conjectures that its the same structure
