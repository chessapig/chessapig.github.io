summary: my favorite manifold is the moduli space of flat $G$-bundles on a Riemann surface. First I`ll construct it first as an infinite dimensional symplectic quotient, then with a finite dimensional model. The finite-dimensional construction looks a lot like symplectic reduction, with a lie group-valued moment map. This motivates the notion of a quasihamiltonian $G$-space, which have $G$-valued moment maps. Finally, I show quasihamiltonian $G$-space are equivalent to ordinary moment maps for loop groups.
