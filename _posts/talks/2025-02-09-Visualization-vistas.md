talk-venue: "OURFA2M2: Online undergraduate research fair for the advancement and alignment of marginalized mathematicians."
summary: "Seeing is believing. There are three axes of mathematical illustration: A picture can exposit mathematical ideas, aid in the discovery of new math, or be an avenue for artistic expression.  We will take a whirlwind tour though several areas of the field, and get acquainted with the varied goals, themes, mediums, and lots and lots of pictures. Many contributors to this field have little formal math training. All you need is a new perspective and some visual flair."
