summary: "The symplectic structure of a Kahler manifold decomposes into two pieces: A symplectic disc bundle over a hyperplane section, and an isotropic skeleton. This Biran decomposition is a symplectic refinement of the Lefshetz hyperplane theorem. The proof uses the morse theory of the norm squared of a holomorphic section of the prequantum line bundle. We will use this to prove some lagrangian barrier phemonena. For example, every symplectic ball of radius $1/\\sqrt{2}$ embedded in $\\mathbb{C} \\mathbb{P}^n$ interesects $\\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{P}^n$"
