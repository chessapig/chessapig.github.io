## Description
We are trying to understand Teleman's [2014 ICM address](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6305). This provides a conjectural picture organizing categorical representations of groups using the framework of 2 and 3 dimensional mirror symmetry. It's notorious for being confusing, but we'll try our best. We'll start with understanding TQFTs, in their fully extended sense, defined using higher categories. (The seminar would still be a success if we understood this!) Then, we'll move on to gauging, understanding this by group actions on categories. Finally, we'll try to understand Teleman's hiroglyphics:
<img src="\assets\images\teleman hiroglyphs.png" alt="Teleman's hyroglyphs" width="500"/>

This is a picture of the Toda space of a group, a holomorphic symplectic manifold built from the group. The KRS two-category should encode and organize topological actions of this group. Each of these objects are bundles of categories over lagrangians in this space.

If we understand this, then we have a geometric picture of categorical representations!

## Talk details

### Week.1
*Speaker:*  Elliot Kienzle, Zechen Bian \\
*Topic:* Hieroglyphics for extended TQFTs \\
*Notes:* [Link to PDF](\files\tqft_notes\extending_tqfts.pdf) \\
*Summary:* Elliot gave a schematic introduction to TQFTs and how they give rise to higher categories. Fairly physically minded, I start with 1 dimensional TQFTs ( Quantum mechanics), and build up the pictures for 2 and 3 dimensional TQFTs. This follows section 2.1-2.2 of [Topological Field Theory, Higher Categories, and Their Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2307) by Kapustin. After this, Zechen gave an plan for the rest of the semester.
