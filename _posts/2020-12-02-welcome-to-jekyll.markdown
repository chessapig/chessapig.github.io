I haven't been myself these past couple weeks. Maybe it's the fall air, maybe quarantine has finally gotten to me, but I've betread one of my core values:

I've been programming.

It started innocently enough, with an idle fantasy of animating pretty shapes. But, instead of quickly remembering why I don't like computers, this time I actually succeeded. I think I got cocky, because now in my infinite hubris, I'm trying to make a website.

I'm making this site with Jekyll, and hoasting it with Github pages. I couldn't use wordpress / squarespace / other site generators, because I want to customize and embed my own code. I've never used github before, so this was kind of a pain, but it ended up easier than I feared. There's a bunch of cool stuff you can do, I've barely scratched the surface. Theres even latex integration:

\[\int \LaTeX \]

### But why??

I want to have all my ~𝓈𝓉𝓊𝒻𝒻~ consolidated, be it acedemic, artistic or educational. Basically, a life portfolio. Right now, I only  have these things posted on my twitter.  For better or worse, twitter does not make it easy to see old tweets, so it's not a good medium for high effort content. So, I'm moving things over. I'll make a pretty gallery with all my drawings / generative art / misc, maybe with a little blurb about my methods. I'm also going to port over my threads, lightly edited for a bloggish format.

I'm also going to use this as a blog. Maybe I'll try explaining some cool math stuff, maybe I'll write about some interesting musings of mine, who knows. I'll try to post fairly often (as far as dicipline allows), because I really ought to practice writing more. Besides, If I force myself to share interesting thoughts, maybe I'll have some interesting thoughts in the first place.
