I haven't been myself these past couple weeks.


And now I made a website!

Theres even latex integration:

It will be nice to have all my ~stuff~ consolidated in one place, be it artistic or acedemic or educational.

I'm going to post all my old twitter threads (lightly edited)

There are pros and cons to the "twitter thread" writing format, but it's pretty obvious the platform was not designed for permenence





<b>this is my first post isnt that cool</b>

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
