I haven't been myself these past couple weeks. Maybe it's the fall air, maybe quarantine has finally gotten to me, but I've betrayed one of my core values...

I've been programming.

It started innocently enough, with an idle fantasy of animating pretty shapes. Usually these flights of fancy end with me quickly remembering why I don't like computers, but this time I actually succeeded. And I think I got cocky, because now in my infinite hubris, I'm making a website.

I'm building this with Jekyll, and hosting it with Github pages (I couldn't use wordpress / squarespace / other site generators, because I want to customize and embed my own code.) I've never used github before, so that was a pain. Not knowing anything, my goal was maximal copy-pasting with minimal understanding (whats a CSS??). Instead of a website, I got Frankensteins monster, robbed from the graves of the default Jekyll theme and <a href="https://singerng.github.io/">https://singerng.github.io/</a>. RIP.

But alas, I failed my goal, and ended up learning something 
🤷. Websites are pretty cool! You can even do latex integration:

### But why??

I want to consolidate all my  ~𝓈𝓉𝓊𝒻𝒻~ , be it academic, artistic or educational. Basically, a life portfolio. Right now I'm using twitter to post all my 𝓈𝓉𝓊𝒻𝒻.  For better or worse, it is not easy to see old tweets, so twitter does not lend itself to high effort content. That's why I'm moving things over. I'll make a pretty gallery with all my drawings / generative art / misc, maybe with a little blurb about my methods. I'm going to port my twitter threads, lightly edited into a bloggish format.

I'm also going to use this as a blog. Maybe I'll try explaining some cool math stuff, maybe I'll write up some interesting musings, we'll have to see. I'll try to post fairly often (as far as discipline allows), because I really ought to practice writing more. Besides, maybe writing about interesting thoughts with force me to have some interesting thoughts in the first place.

Stick around, there are big things to come.
