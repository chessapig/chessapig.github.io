summary: Periodic crystals on the hyperbolic plane underlie an emerging bridge between condensed matter physics and algebraic geometry. Mathematically, hyperbolic crystals prompt us to study the spectrum of the hyperbolic laplacian plus a potential which is periodic under some hyperbolic lattice. Motivated by band theory, the space of functions splits into representations of the hyperbolic lattice, decomposing the spectrum into "bands" over the moduli space of such representations. Geometrically, these bands are the spectrum of the laplacian of a flat connection on the associated Riemann surface, graphed over the moduli space of such connections.  After introducing this, I will discuss my own work (joint with Steve Rayan) incorporating Higgs bundles into the story.  Higgs bundles enjoy a couple natural spectral-theoretic interpretations, first appearing from complex representations, and second encoding symmetries of the underlying hyperbolic lattice. Time permitting, I'll daydream about how Higgs bundles might weave hyperbolic crystals into a web of ideas across mathematics and physics.

paper-abstract: Hyperbolic lattices underlie a new form of quantum matter with potential applications to quantum computing and simulation and which, to date, have been engineered artificially. A corresponding hyperbolic band theory has emerged, extending 2-dimensional Euclidean band theory in a natural way to higher-genus configuration spaces. Attempts to develop the hyperbolic analogue of Bloch's theorem have revealed an intrinsic role for algebro-geometric moduli spaces, notably those of stable bundles on a curve. We expand this picture to include Higgs bundles, which enjoy natural interpretations in the context of band theory. First, their spectral data encodes a crystal lattice and momentum, providing a framework for symmetric hyperbolic crystals. Second, they act as a complex analogue of crystal momentum. As an application, we elicit a new perspective on Euclidean band theory. Finally, we speculate on potential interactions of hyperbolic band theory, facilitated by Higgs bundles, with other themes in mathematics and physics.

For a gentle introduction to this project,  see my Twitter threads: [part 1](https://twitter.com/chessapigbay/status/1488375642391470081) and [part 2](https://twitter.com/chessapigbay/status/1489733324054704128)
  

  
This project explores a bridge between algebraic geometry and condensed matter physics. On the physics end, we consider the quantum physics of hyperbolic crystals. Imagine an electron on a two-dimensional hyperbolic plane, evolving under a potential that is periodic under a set of hyperbolic translations. For example, Fig. 1 shows a regular hyperbolic crystal. The quantum properties come from the spectral theory of an associated periodic Schrodinger operator. We can understand the spectrum much better if we split it according to representations of the symmetries, a technique called *hyperbolic band theory*.

In algebraic geometry land, representations of the crystal symmetries become vector bundles on Riemann surfaces (See [Hyperbolic band theory](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe9170)). In this project, we extend this theory to Higgs bundles, a complexified analog of Higgs bundles. We find two independent crystalographic interpretations of Higgs bundles, one from the algebro-geometric side of Higgs bundles, and the other from the representation-theoretic side.
