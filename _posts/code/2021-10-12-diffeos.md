summary: An illustration of dynamics of a random map from the plane to itself. It plots the trajectories of a few random points, showing where and how they accumulate. The map is periodically modulating perlin noise. As the map changes, you can see all sorts of bifurcations and dynamic effects. Here are some more [examples](https://twitter.com/chessapigbay/status/1448164156713078785), and a little more [context](https://twitter.com/chessapigbay/status/1448151992426172416)
