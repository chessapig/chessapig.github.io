# Teaching

Here Classes I've designed and taught myself. Click the link to see the course page
- Spring 2024:  [Math crafts: How things curve](/teaching/math-crafts)
  - Hands-on introduction to curvature and creative mathematics. Each week, we'd build a arts and crafts project exploring curvature and its many manifestations.  
- Fall 2021:  [MATH299G: Geometry in physics](/teaching/STIC)
  - Seminar style to differential forms and geometry, and their role in physics. Focused on the differential forms interpretation of maxwells equations, and the sympelctic geometry formulation of symplectic geometry.


Here are classes I've GSI's for (berkeley's name for teaching assistants). 
- Spring 2023: GSI for MATH54, linear algebra.
- Fall 2022: GSI for MATH53, multivariable calculus. See the [Course page](/teaching/MATH53_Fall_2022/)

# Organization

- Spring 2023: Organized a [Coloumb branch reading seminar](/teaching/Coloumb)


# Mentoring
Mentor for UC Berkeley directed reading program:
- Fall 2022: Introduction to mirror symmetry
- Fall 2023: Connections, curvature, charecteristic classes (Following [Tu Differential geometry](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-55084-8))

# Outreach


## Momath
During the summer of 2022, I worked at the National Meusuem of Mathematics (MoMath) as a Docent (the people in the staff shirt who walk around and help guests). I spent 7 hours a day running around, teaching kids riding the square-wheeled tricycle about catenary curves, and rolling children  across the Reulouxs, regaling them about constant width shapes. I had lots of fun, met lots of great people, and learned how to better use math to connect with people of all ages.
