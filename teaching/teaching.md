## Momath
During the summer of 2022, I worked at the National Meusuem of Mathematics (MoMath) as a Docent (the people in the staff shirt who walk around and help guests). I spent 7 hours a day running around, teaching kids riding the square-wheeled tricycle about catenary curves, and rolling children  across the Reulouxs, regaling them about constant width shapes. I had lots of fun, met lots of great people, and learned how to better use math to connect with people of all ages.
