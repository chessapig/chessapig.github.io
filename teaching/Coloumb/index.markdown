## Description
We'll be learning about coloumb branches, a structure arising from a supersymmetric quantum field theory. Physically, this represents a sector of the moduli space of vacua, forming a (possibly singular) manifold.  Supersymmetry endows this with all sorts of structure, like a hyperkahler metric. Historically, we understand this only thru specific examples, but those examples are rich and varied. They include:

- Elliptic fibrations (Seiberg-Witten theory)
- quiver varieties of various forms
- ALE hyperkahler spaces a.la kronheimer 
- gauge theoretic moduli spaces of instatons (The Atiyah-Hitchen moduli space of $$SU(2)$$ instatons, moduli spaces of ASD yang-mills connections, etc)
- springer resolutions and other critters from geometric representation theory

These examples suggest that coloumb branches are more than mere hyperkaheler manifolds. They usually connect to gauge theoretic moduli spaces. They often connect to geometric representation theory. They have subtle dualities (Mirror symmetry) which shed new light on gauge theory and representation theory. All this begs for a general, unifying desecription coloumb branches and their geometry. *In this seminar, we will try to understand the couloumb branches of $$3D \; \mathcal{N}=4$$ supersymmetric quantum field theories.*


## Resources

Coloumb branches are a active area of research which is not yet mature, meaning we don't have any textbooks to read. Instead we'll follow some papers in the mathematical physics literature

*History*:
- [Electric - magnetic duality, monopole condensation, and confinement in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9407087)
  - The premiere work by seiberg and witten introduced Coloumb branches and coloumb branch geometry, as a tool to find the low enegry effective field theory for $$\mathcal{N}=2$$ yang mills theory. This paper also lead to seiberg-witten theory, a gauge theoretic topological set of invariants dual to donaldson theory. Since this work is in 4D and $$\mathcal{N}=2$$, the coloumb branch is not hyperkahler. Still, it anticipates many core ideas and developments in the field.

*Physics*:
- [Mirror Symmetry in Three Dimensional Gauge Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9607207)
  - Paper from the 90s, shortly after the Seiberg-Witten paper. Discusses coloumb branches and mirror symmetry in the context of ALE hyperkahler spaces, like those studied by [Kronheimer](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/9789814539395_0034).
- [The Coulomb Branch of $$3D \; \mathcal{N}=4$$ Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04817)
  - Provides a general construction of Coloumb branches for $$3D \; \mathcal{N}=4$$ theories, from a physics perspective.
- [Coulomb branches with complex singularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03152)
- [SUSY localization for Coulomb branch operators in omega-deformed $$3D \; \mathcal{N}=4$$ gauge theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01802)

*Mathematics*:
- Towards a mathematical definition of Coulomb branches of $$3D \; \mathcal{N}=4$$ gauge theories [I](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03676) and [II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03586)
  - This introduces the Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima (BFN) construction, a mathematically precise definition of coloumb branches. This is the spectrum of the ring of some equivariant homology (or K-theory) of a based loop group. Understanding what this possibly means, or how it relates to the physics above, is one of my goals this semster. 

- [The role of Coulomb branches in 2D gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10124)
  - an alternative description/construction of the spaces constructed by BFN in the above paper


## Talk details

### 2/1
*Speaker:* Elliot Kienzle \\
*Topic:* Planning meeting \\
*Notes:* [Day one notes](\files\coloumb_notes\day_1.pdf) \\
*Summary:* Discussed the motivation behind coloumb branches, and why we care about studying them. Discussed the future topics of the reading seminar.


### 2/8
*Speaker:* Eric Jankowski, Elliot Kienzle \\
*Topic:* Superalgebras \\
*Notes:*  [Lie superalgebras](\files\coloumb_notes\day_2_pt_1.pdf), [Physicist's supersymmetry algebras](\files\coloumb_notes\day_2_pt_2.pdf) \\
*Video:* [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KDAFLx7-bo&list=PLsy8IQq7bK4d5eh-lyy_MH8HFbfD2udgJ&index=2&ab_channel=ElliotKienzle)\\
*Summary:* Eric introduced supersymmetric lie algebras discussing their basic properties and classification. This follwed  [A sketch of Lie superalgebra theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01609166) by Kac, and [MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF SUPERSYMMETRY](https://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5742) by Caston and Fioresi. Elliot described what physicsts call a supersymmetry algebra, described in the first part of chapter 5 of [Hyperkahler metrics and supersymmetry](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01214418) by HKLR.

### 2/15
*Speaker:*  Elliot Kienzle \\
*Topic:* Spin, spinor, spinest\\
*Notes:*   [First ~1.5 pages](\files\coloumb_notes\day_3.pdf)\\
*Video:* [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCPXjXR48Fg&list=PLsy8IQq7bK4d5eh-lyy_MH8HFbfD2udgJ&index=2&ab_channel=ElliotKienzle)\\
*Summary:* Quick scamper through clifford algebras, spins, and spinor representations. The material can be found in a great many places, for example [Spin Geometry, Lawson and Michelson](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bpmb28). I focus on $$3D$$ spinors with signature $$(2,1)$$, following the development in chapter 5 [Hyperkahler metrics and supersymmetry](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01214418). I conclude with the notion that a spinor is a square root of a vector (a general philosophy which manifests particularly nicely in 3 dimensions), and a disucssion of Bott Periodicity:

### 2/22
*Speaker:*  Elliot Kienzle \\
*Topic:* Square roots in supersymmetry\\
*Notes:*   [pages 1.5 to end](\files\coloumb_notes\day_3.pdf)\\
*Summary:* We'll talk about supersymmetry in the context of quantum field theory. Philosophically, we describe various ways in which supersymmetry gives square roots of familiar objects: A spinor is the square root of a vector, a supersymmetry transform is the square root of translation, and multiple superpersymmetries give square roots of negative 1. We will roughly follow chapter 5 of [Hyperkahler metrics and supersymmetry](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01214418), talking about superspace, superfields, the meaning of $$\mathcal{N}=1,2,4$$ supersymmetry. This is supplemented by parts of [Five Lectures on Supersymmetry, by Dan Freed](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=FLS). 


### 3/1
*Speaker:*  Che Shen \\
*Topic:* Hyperkahler geometry through supersymmetry\\
*Notes:*  \\
*Summary:* We introduce the hyperkahler quotient, and how it arises from supersymmetry. Followes  [Hyperkahler metrics and supersymmetry](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01214418).
