##  Overview
How do things curve? How can you build things that curve? More fundamentally, *what does it mean to curve?* This course will take a *hands on, intuitive* approach to these questions. We will follow two parallel paths: 

- *Crafts:*  To understand geometry with our hands, we will build many curved spaces. Each one uses different craft mediums and exemplifies techniques for creating curvature. 
- *Math:* The mathematical framework for exploring curvature is called differential geometry. We will build an informal understanding of two dimensional geometry, including the shape of curved surfaces and the counterintuitive life of an ant on a curved surface.

We will explore, we will discover, and we'll have fun! Each class, we'll build an arts and crafts project illustrating that day's topic. For more open-ended exploration, there will be 3 mini-projects over the semester. These go deeper into the crafts and topic from class. At the end of the semester, everyone will bring their mini-projects for a class-wide show and tell.

The course is meant as a general-education math course. Coming from math, this course illustrates geometry emphasizing physicality and intuition. Coming from art, this course is a friendly, visual introduction to some beautiful ideas not seen until upper level math classes. If this sounds interesting and fun, then this course is designed for you!

The goal of this class is to have fun and explore cool math crafts together. This class is an inclusive space. The class policy is to be accomodating, accepting, and open. Everyone will adhere to these values in class.

## Grading policy

- Attendance (45%)
- Mini projects (15% each, 45% total)
- Show and tell (10%)

Passing grade is above 70%. 

### Attendance
If you participate in the activity for each class, you will get attendance points. 2 classes may be dropped. If you have any issues, please talk to the facilitator (Elliot :) )
### Mini projects
After each class, there is an option to do a mini project. These are small, guided but open ended explorations of the ideas from class, where you construct something of your own. You will choose 3 of the mini projects to do over the course of the semester, one from each third of the class. These are due on the fifth, 10th, and final weeks, though due dates are flexible. Talk to me if you have any issues.
You are strongly encouraged to work on these projects in groups. Expect them to take 2-4 hours each -- Iâ€™m imagining you meeting with friends from class over the weekend to make something fun. To get the grade, come show me what you made, and explain how it relates to the math we discussed in class. Grading based on completion. You can come during office hours, or at the end of class.

### Show and tell
The last class of the semester will be show and tell. You will bring in all the results of your mini-project from the semester to class, and set up booths around the room. Think of it like a science fair. You will go around the booths, and describe some of the projects your peers worked on. Grading based on completion.
