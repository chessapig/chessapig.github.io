# Videos

Here are some math videos I've made!

### The Cobordism Exhibition 
An introduction to the cobordism ring and its role in math. See more information [here](/talk/cobordism)

### Lie derivatives, Louiville's theorem, and poincare recurrence
A series of 3 videos I made for my [Geometry in physics class](/teaching/STIC). I've linked the playlist. Here's the topic of each video:
1. Lie derivatives of differential forms, and an integration proof of cartan's magic formula
2. The elegant proof of Louiville's theorem using symplectic geometry
3. Poincare recurrence, proved with a hungry worm.
