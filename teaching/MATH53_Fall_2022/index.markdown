## Resources

The textbook is Stewart's *Multivariable calculus, Early Transcendentals, eight edition.* You can find this online on libgen.is, by searching "Calculus: Early Transcendentals 8th Edition"". The multivar section is the second half of the book. The UC Berkeley edition simply deletes a couple chapters, it is not necessary

#### MATH53 specific resources
 - A [cheat sheet ](https://math.berkeley.edu/~jrowan/53F18/MATH53-TRIG.pdf) of useful trig identities
 - Past [Math 53 Exams](https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/archives/exams/math-53)

#### Online Resources
- [Paul's online math notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/CalcIII.aspx)
	- Has pages on all the topics we will talk about in class, along with worked out examples
- [Calculus BLUE](https://www.youtube.com/c/ProfGhristMath/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=1)
	- For visual learners, this has lots of well animated videos on every topic in this class.
	- Our class will cover the basic aspects of volume 1, and most of volume 2 and 3. If you're having trouble with any of the subjects, see if they have a video on it.
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
	- Online graphing calculator, useful for parametric curves and polar coordinates
- [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/3d)
	- Online 3D grapher, helps you see functions 
- [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)
	- Symbolic calculator. Very useful for solving annoying integrals
	- Berkeley gives you [free access](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/alphapro) to wolfram alpha pro. This will give you step by step directions on how to solve problems.
	- Be *Cautious* with this. While it can solve many of the homework problems, remember that homework makes a negligible impact on your final grade. Use this tool to supplement your learning and problem solving, not supplant it. You won't have it on the exams.

## Homework and Quiz policy

#### Homework
Homework is collected on gradescope. **The code for entry is 2KB7ZP**. It is due each Monday. *(Exceptions: The first homework is due on Friday, sept. 2. The second homework is due on Tuesday, sept 6th due to labor day.)*
The starred problems on homework will be graded for completion. I will be checking to make sure if it seems like you know what you're doing, or if you're  writing nonsense. 

#### Quizzes
By popular demand, quizzes will be biweekly on Wednesday. They will cover questions from the proceeding two weeks. **The first quiz will be Wednesday, Sept. 7**.
